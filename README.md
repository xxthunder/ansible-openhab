openhab
=========

This role will set up an openHAB server as Docker container and is heavily inspired by [rkoshak](https://github.com/rkoshak)s post [Ansible Revisited](https://community.openhab.org/t/ansible-revisited/105754) in the [openHAB community](https://community.openhab.org).

**Work In Progress**: While the role is already functional, molecule test are rudimentary / non existent.


### It will
- create an openHAB service account
- add the system user to the openHAB service group
- if configured: seed `conf/` and `userdata/` from two separate git repositories
- create missing folders & set permissions
- pull the latest openHAB image and recreate the container if it changed

Role Variables
--------------

`openhab/defaults/main` contains variables which should be overwritten to customize this role:
```yml
# to be added to the openhab user group
system_user: link
# openhab user ID
openhab_uid: 9001
# root directory of openhab data
openhab_home: /opt/docker/openhab
# openHAB config repository [optional]
# Authentication has to be resolved beforehand, one option would be SSH Key 
# Authentication.
# Example: ssh://{{ system_user }}@git.example.com:port/path/to/repo/openhab.git
# NOTE: superseded -- see "Two repositories" below.
openhab_repo:
# which branch?
openhab_repo_branch: master
# should local changes be discarded?
openhab_repo_force: yes
# which openHAB version should be pulled from Docker?
openhab_version: latest
# Docker container hostname
openhab_hostname: openhab
# TimeZone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
openhab_timezone: Europe/Berlin
```

Requirements
------------

- [git](https://git-scm.com) - might be installed & configured via [weareinteractive.git](https://github.com/weareinteractive/ansible-git)
- [OpenSSH Server](https://www.openssh.com) - might be installed via [weareinteractive.apt](https://github.com/weareinteractive/ansible-apt)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - might be installed via [geerlingguy.docker_arm](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker_arm)

Dependencies
------------

- *create-service-account*: a role copied from [rkoshak](https://github.com/rkoshak)s post [Ansible Revisited](https://community.openhab.org/t/ansible-revisited/105754) in the [openHAB community](https://community.openhab.org):
  ```yml
  ---
  # tasks file for create-service-account

  - name: "Create {{ service_user }} group so we can control the gid"
    group:
      gid: "{{ gid }}"
      name: "{{ service_user }}"
      state: present
      system: True
    become: True

  - name: "Create {{ service_user }} user"
    user:
      comment: "{{ service }} service"
      createhome: "{{ create_home }}"
      group: "{{ service_user }}"
      name: "{{ service_user }}"
      shell: /usr/sbin/nologin
      state: present
      system: True
      uid: "{{ uid }}"
    become: True

  - name: "Add {{ system_user }} to the {{ service_user }} group"
    user:
      append: True
      groups: "{{ service_user }}"
      name: "{{ system_user }}"
    become: True
  ```

Example Playbook
----------------
This role is only one step in setting up a new server - if you have already a prepared server the following play would be enough:

```yml
- name: Playbook to add an openHAB Docker image
  hosts: openhab
  debugger: on_failed
  become: true

  tasks:
  - include_role: 
      name: openhab
```

If you have to setup a server from scratch the following play might give you a hint about which steps are needed:

```yml
# invoke with `ansible-playbook openhab-play.yml --vault-id openhab@prompt`

- name: Playbook to set up an openHAB server on a Raspberry Pi
  hosts: openhab
  gather_facts: false
  debugger: on_failed
  become: true

  tasks:
    # * rename the default user *pi* to *user_name*
    # * set a new user password *user_password*
    # * rename the home dir */home/{{ user_name_old }}* to */home/{{ user_name_new }}*
    # * create a symlink */home/{{ user_name_old }}* linking to */home/{{ user_name_new }}*
    # * change the hostname to *host_name*
    # * configure locale
    # * set timezone to *localization_timezone*
    # * activate auto-updates / -upgrades
    # * install and configure vim
    # * set sensible defaults for the SSH server
    # * write public SSH keys to *user_name*'s *authorized_keys* file
    # * install and configure a firewall (ufw)
    - include_role: 
        name: prepare-raspberry
    # open ports necessary for openHAB
    - include_role:

      vars:

            name: "{{ git_commit_user_name }}"
            email: "{{ git_commit_user_email }}"
    # install pip (requirement for docker_arm)
    - include_role: 
        name: geerlingguy.pip
    # install docker
    - include_role: 
        name: geerlingguy.docker_arm
    # reboot
    - include_role: 
        name: GROG.reboot
    # install openHAB
    - include_role:
        name: "openhab"
      vars:
        system_user: "{{ user_name }}"
    # install the Web-Log-Viewer also used in openHABian 
    - include_role:
        name: "frontail"
    # reduce SD Card wear
    - include_role:
        name: "minimize-writes"
    # create SMB share for the openHAB configuration
    - include_role:
        name: "bertvv.samba"
    # I use this Raspberry only for openHAB -> when I SSH onto the server, I almost always want to go to the openHAB folder
    - name: SSH into openHAB folder
      blockinfile:
        path: /home/{{ user_name }}/.bashrc
        block: |
          # on login jump to openhab directory
          cd {{ openhab_home }}

Two repositories: config and state
----------------------------------

openHAB's `openhab_home` holds two things with opposite ownership, and this
role no longer treats them as one:

| Variable | Seeds | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openhab_conf_repo` | `{{ openhab_home }}/conf` | the repo |
| `openhab_state_repo` | `{{ openhab_home }}/userdata` | the host |

`conf/` is declarative automation — items, rules, scripts, sitemaps. `userdata/`
is runtime state: thing status, jsondb, user sessions, and generated secrets
that rotate on their own. A single repo forced them to share one policy, and
`openhab_repo_force: yes` applied that policy to the whole tree, so every deploy
discarded runtime state. **`openhab_repo`, `openhab_repo_branch` and
`openhab_repo_force` are removed**; setting `openhab_repo` now fails the run
with a pointer here rather than silently doing nothing.

### Seed once, never fetch

Both repositories are used only to *seed* an unseeded target. On a converged
host the role does no fetch at all — it only corrects a drifted `origin` URL,
which cannot touch the working tree. Consequences worth being explicit about:

- **The host needs no git credential in steady state.** Nothing authenticates
  to your git server on a normal run, so no private key belongs on the managed
  host. (An earlier version of this role passed `key_file` pointing at one; that
  is gone.)
- **Publishing new config is a deliberate operator step** — a manual pull — not
  something a deploy performs unannounced.
- **A populated tree can never be reset.** There is no code path that does it.

The two differ only in what counts as unseeded: `conf/` when it contains no
`.git`, `userdata/` when the *directory itself* is absent. That asymmetry is the
safety property — a `userdata/` that exists without a `.git` is a hand-built
host carrying the only copy of its runtime state, and seeding it would overwrite
exactly that.

`addons/` stays role-created and unversioned.

### Operator identity

`openhab_git_user_name` / `openhab_git_user_email` write a `[user]` block into
`/root/.gitconfig` so host-side commits attribute to a person rather than
`root@<host>`. The role also registers both trees under `[safe] directory`,
without which git 2.35.2+ refuses to operate as root on a working tree owned by
the service user.

### Testing

`molecule/git-seeding` covers this wiring end to end against bare repositories
created inside the container, so it needs no network, no git server and no
credentials:

```sh
molecule test -s git-seeding
```

`molecule/default` remains rudimentary and is not part of this scenario.
